                <ul>
            <li>The <strong>1979 World Climate Conference</strong> was the first major global meeting on climate change. It urged nations “to foresee and to prevent potential man-made changes in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity.”</li>
           <br><li>In <strong>1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</strong> was formed to study human-caused climate change and suggest possible solutions.</li>
          <br> <li>The <strong>Kyoto Protocol</strong> was adopted in <strong>1997. </strong>It focused on reducing six major greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane.</li>  
                <br><ul><li>The <strong>United States</strong>, although a major emitter, rejected the agreement because it felt the protocol's rules would hurt the economy and were unfair for not including developing countries.</li>
            <br><li>In <strong>2005</strong>, the protocol officially went into effect after <strong>Russia</strong> approved it, meeting the required threshold for ratification.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><li>Public awareness increased with the 2006 release of An Inconvenient Truth by <strong>Al Gore</strong>, and the documentary based on it helped spread knowledge about the dangers of climate change.</li>
            <br><li><strong>In 2007, Al Gore and the IPCC won the Nobel Peace Prize</strong> for “efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change.”</li>
        </ul>
