    <u><h2>There's a SECOND Industrial Revolution?! : The Industrial Shift</h2></u>
    <p>Yes! In the late 19th and 20th centuries, a “new” Industrial Revolution emerged, 
      building on the old but introducing major changes. Industries began using new materials like lighter metals,
       rare earths, plastics, and synthetic products, along with new energy sources. This period also saw the rise of advanced machines,
        tools, and computers that led to the development of fully automatic factories, going beyond the earlier mechanization and assembly lines.

      Ownership of production shifted from a few wealthy individuals to a broader base through stock purchases by individuals and institutions. Many European countries began socializing key parts of their economies, and governments took a more active role in managing industrial societies, moving away from the hands-off “laissez-faire” approach. However, starting in the 1980s, countries like the U.S. and the U.K. reversed this trend, reducing government involvement in the economy.</p>
