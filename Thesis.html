    <h1>In Conclusion...</h1>
    <h3>Human activities have accelerated global warming, but individuals and societies can reduce its impact by transitioning to renewable energy, protecting natural ecosystems, and making sustainable lifestyle choices. </h3>
    <p>The Message for you all today is that Global Warming is becoming very serious, and we all need to do our parts in order to solve this global crisis.</p>
    <p>Mistakes Humans have made in the past may have cost us something, but that doesnt mean that we should keep making those same mistakes. This is because we know what we should be doing to solve and prevent Global warming, while past humans did not.</p>
    <p>All the information i've found has really backed up the first question I had asked. </p>
    <div class="containers">
        <p>Making this Inquiry Project was definitely not easy.</p>
        <p> Some challenges I faced while building this project was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding Credible resources for this website</li>
            <li>Building this website</li>
            <li>Trying to find paraphrases from the different articles</li>
            <li>There was a huge amount of information per article, and it was quite overwhelming trying to figure out whats most relevant and reliable</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Something that really suprised me when i was researching is that Cows also play a big role in the greenhouse effect. You may be wondering how, but because Cows eat plants and grass, they are hard to digest and eventually, their stomach makes Methane gas. Then the cow proceeds to burp the gas out, releasing it into the air.</p>
    <p>this really matters because methane is more than 25x stronger than carbon dioxide in holding heat.</p>
