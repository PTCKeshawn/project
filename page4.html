    <u><h2>What is the GreenHouse Effect? </h2></u>
    <p>The greenhouse effect is the process that keeps Earth's surface warm enough to support life.
         according to <strong>Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia</strong>, “Greenhouse Effect is the trapping of heat by certain gases
        in the atmosphere of a planet, such as the earth.” These gases allow sunlight to reach the surface but trap the heat that radiates back as infrared energy. Without this natural process, 
        <strong>Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia</strong> states that “temperatures on earth would be roughly 30° C (60° F) lower.” However,
         while this effect is essential for life, human activities have increased the concentration of these gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), leading to a stronger
         greenhouse effect and thus global warming.
        Out of all those  gases, carbon doixide (CO₂) is responsible for trapping the most heat in the atmosphere.</p>

         it is the last picture taken by a human from space and is the only photo we have in which the Earth is fully illuminated instead of partially shrouded in darkness."</i></p>    
    <p>Scientific data confirms that greenhouse gas levels have sharply increased due to human activity. According to <strong>Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia</strong>, “global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were 35 percent greater than they were prior to the Industrial Revolution,” and methane levels were “some 150 percent greater than in 1750.” These gases come from burning fossil fuels, agriculture, industrial processes, and even waste. The article also mentions that “Earth’s average surface temperature has increased by about 1.8°F (1°C) since the mid-1800s,” mainly because of this human-caused rise in greenhouse gases. Scientists warn that if current trends continue, temperatures could rise by as much as 6.4°C (11.5°F) by the end of the century, with severe consequences for ecosystems and human life.</p>
