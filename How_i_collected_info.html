    <h1><u>How I Collected my Info:</u></h1>
    <p>To gather my information, I used EBSCO and other online databases to search for full-text articles that explained the greenhouse effect, climate change, and the role of human activity. I looked for sources that were reliable, clear, and based on scientific evidence. I also found helpful one video about the 2005 Montreal protest for global warming. It showed how others around us are trying to spread more awareness, proving one of my points.<br><br> I kept track of each source by copying the titles and links into a Word document. To stay organized, I sorted the sources into three categories: ELA, Social Studies, and Science. This helped me understand how the topic connects across subjects. For example, science articles explained how greenhouse gases trap heat, while social studies sources focused on historical events that contributed to global warming, such as the Industrial Revolution and the creation of climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol. This method helped me stay focused and keep my research well-organized.</p>
